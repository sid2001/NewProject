MCU and SFU seems correct way to transfer streams
MCU is basically mixing the received the streams and relaying to every peer 
SFU creates separate channels to relay different streams to each peer

-------> What goes on while negotiation process? <--------

Well SFU seems better option to avoid traffic issues due to one peer acting abnormally since the channels are
different so there will be no problem due to one stream even taking action will become much convenient peer wise.

SFU may cause unsynchronised video from peers.<<<<<< need to look into this later

How to make a SFU


OOOOOOO>Why TURN works: because it sits on the public IP
